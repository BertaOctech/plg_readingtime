{"name":"Estimated Reading Time","tagline":"Joomla! Content Plugin","body":"### About Estimated Reading Time Joomla Plugin\r\nThis Joomla! plugin will show the estimated reading time of your articles just below the title. The plugin will show the estimated reading time in the article detail view as well as in frontpage or article list views.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThis plugin is installed as a regular Joomla Plugin, so just grab the installation package (see the packages links on top of this page) and put it into your Joomla! Extension installer and click install.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nAfter installing the plugin go to the plugin manager in your Joomla! site and click on the plugin name for configuring it.\r\n\r\nYou can configure following settings:\r\n\r\n- **Excluded Categories.** Use this to specify categories which articles will not show Estimated Reading Time.\r\n\r\n- **Use Default Styling.** With this setting you can specify if you want to use default styling or specify your custom style below.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Styling.** Here you can add your custom css for the article reading time text. Text here will be included in a _style_ HTML property of the container tag.\r\n\r\n- **Hide Output.** This option makes the plugin to not add the reading time to your article layout. This is useful if you want to use reading time directly in a template override for your article.\r\n\r\n#### Template Overrides\r\nSince version 3.4.0 you can now use template overrides to customize plugin output and you can also integrate reading time values directly in your article template overrides.\r\n\r\n##### Customizing plugin output with templates overrides\r\nYou just need to copy the file: *plugins/content/readingtime/tmpl/default* to the folder *templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/html/plg_content_readingtime/default.php* and modify styling there as per your needs.\r\n\r\n##### Adding reading time directly to your template overrides.\r\nIf you want to include reading time information directly into your template override, since version 3.4.0 you can easily do it. If you check the item object in your article template, you will notice there is a new property called readingtime. This property is an object with 3 properties:\r\n\r\n- `$this->item->readingtime->slowtime` : The slower time your users might take reading the article\r\n- `$this->item->readingtime->quicktime` : The quicker time your users might take reading the article\r\n- `$this->item->readingtime->formattedtime` : The plugin output, which you can override using directions in previous section.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nWe currently have no demo site for this, but you can see in action in the [blog of ManualesJoomla.es](http://manualesjoomla.es/es/blog) where we show the plugin using a template overrides and even a language override!!\r\n\r\n### Translation Credits\r\nEstimated Reading Time plugin is available in English, Spanish and Dutch.
